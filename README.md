# Spotify-Songs-Genre-Segmentation


# Overview
This project aims to explore and analyze a dataset of Spotify songs to segment them into different genres using machine learning techniques. The ultimate goal is to build a recommendation system that suggests similar songs based on their features and clustering analysis.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about various attributes of Spotify songs, including acoustic features, popularity, genres, and more.

# Project Structure
1. Data Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, convert data types, and prepare it for analysis.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and summary statistics are used to gain insights into the distribution of features, genre distribution, and relationships between variables.
3. Clustering Analysis: K-means clustering is applied to segment songs into different clusters based on their acoustic features.
4. Model Building: A recommendation system is built based on the clusters generated from the clustering analysis. Given a song, the system suggests similar songs from the same cluster.
5. Further Steps: Recommendations for future directions, such as feature engineering, advanced clustering techniques, and model optimization, are provided.
